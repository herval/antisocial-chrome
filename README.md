# Anti-Social

A Chrome plugin that gets rid of comment blocks on sites.

If you tend to get distracted (or worse, tend to engage in [commenting](http://xkcd.com/481/)), this plugin will replace all comment blocks (at least the most common ones - eg. Disqus, Facebook, Fyre, YouTube, etc) with an Emoji. Much happier, such wow!
